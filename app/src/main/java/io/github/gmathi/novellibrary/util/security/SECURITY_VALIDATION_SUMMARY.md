  - Application context validation

## Security Tests Implemented

### 1. Unit Tests
- `DependencySecurityValidatorTest`: Tests core security validation logic
- `SecureNetworkHelperTest`: Tests network security features
- `HiltSecurityValidatorTest`: Tests Hilt-specific security validation

### 2. Integration Tests
- `DependencyRelationshipValidationTest`: Validates all dependency relationships
- `ScopingValidationTest`: Tests proper scoping to prevent memory leaks
- `MemoryLeakPreventionTest`: Validates memory leak prevention
- `SecurityComplianceIntegrationTest`: End-to-end security compliance testing

### 3. Test Modules
- `TestSecurityModule`: Provides mock security components for testing

## Security Validations Covered

### Dependency Injection Security
✅ **Application Context Validation**: Ensures only Application context is used for singletons
✅ **Null Dependency Detection**: Prevents null dependencies from being injected
✅ **Injection Timing Validation**: Ensures components are accessed after proper initialization
✅ **Critical Dependency Validation**: Validates all essential dependencies are secure

### Network Security
✅ **HTTPS Enforcement**: Only HTTPS connections are allowed
✅ **URL Validation**: Blocks localhost and local IP addresses
✅ **Certificate Pinning**: Support for certificate pinning on critical domains
✅ **Security Headers**: Automatic injection of security headers

### Database Security
✅ **External Access Prevention**: Blocks external database access
✅ **Encryption Awareness**: Validates encryption configuration
✅ **Secure Configuration**: Ensures database is configured securely

### Scoping Security
✅ **Singleton Validation**: Ensures singletons maintain proper identity
✅ **Memory Leak Prevention**: Validates proper scoping prevents memory leaks
✅ **Lifecycle Alignment**: Ensures components align with intended lifecycle
✅ **Circular Reference Detection**: Prevents circular dependency issues

### Runtime Security
✅ **Injection Context Validation**: Validates appropriate injection contexts
✅ **Component Integrity**: Ensures components maintain integrity during usage
✅ **Stress Testing**: Validates security under heavy load conditions
✅ **Error Handling**: Proper security error detection and handling

## Security Requirements Compliance

### Requirement 3.4 (Security Best Practices)
✅ **Implemented**: All injected dependencies are validated for security
✅ **Implemented**: Secure configuration for network components
✅ **Implemented**: Security-focused test modules for testing
✅ **Implemented**: Security validation for dependency injection

### Requirement 4.2 (Testing Security)
✅ **Implemented**: Comprehensive testing support with security validation
✅ **Implemented**: Mock security components for testing
✅ **Implemented**: Security compliance testing

### Requirements 3.1, 3.3 (Dependency Relationships and Scoping)
✅ **Implemented**: Validation tests for all dependency relationships
✅ **Implemented**: Automated tests for proper scoping
✅ **Implemented**: Memory leak prevention validation
✅ **Implemented**: Integration tests for security compliance

## Security Monitoring and Alerting

### Compile-Time Security
- Hilt provides compile-time validation for missing bindings
- Security validators catch configuration issues early
- Type safety prevents many security vulnerabilities

### Runtime Security
- Continuous validation of dependency integrity
- Security violation detection and logging
- Performance monitoring for security overhead

### Testing Security
- Comprehensive test coverage for all security aspects
- Automated security regression testing
- Mock security components for isolated testing

## Security Best Practices Enforced

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Components only receive necessary dependencies
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security validation
3. **Fail Secure**: Security violations cause immediate failure
4. **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated before use
5. **Secure Defaults**: All configurations default to secure settings
6. **Monitoring and Logging**: All security events are logged
7. **Testing**: Comprehensive security testing at all levels

## Performance Impact

The security validation has minimal performance impact:
- Validation occurs primarily at injection time (startup)
- Runtime validation is lightweight and cached
- No impact on normal application operation
- Security overhead is negligible compared to benefits

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Security Reviews
- Security validation should be reviewed with each Hilt update
- New dependencies should be added to security validation
- Security tests should be updated with new features

### Security Configuration Updates
- Certificate pins should be updated as needed
- Security policies should be reviewed regularly
- Validation rules should be updated based on threat landscape

## Conclusion

The Hilt migration includes comprehensive security validation that:
- Ensures all dependencies are secure and properly configured
- Prevents common security vulnerabilities in dependency injection
- Provides extensive testing coverage for security compliance
- Maintains minimal performance impact while maximizing security
- Follows industry best practices for secure dependency injection

All security requirements have been met and validated through extensive testing.
