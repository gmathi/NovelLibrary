# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the Novel Library Android application from a multi-activity architecture to a modern single activity architecture using advanced architectural patterns. The migration will leverage Navigation Component, fragment-based navigation, and modern Android architecture patterns to create a more maintainable, performant, and user-friendly application.

The current application has 20+ activities handling different features like novel reading, library management, settings, downloads, and extensions. The goal is to consolidate these into a single MainActivity with fragment-based navigation while implementing clean architecture principles.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from multiple activities to a single activity architecture, so that the app has better navigation flow, improved performance, and easier state management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app launches THEN the system SHALL use a single MainActivity as the entry point
2. WHEN navigating between screens THEN the system SHALL use Navigation Component with fragments instead of starting new activities
3. WHEN the user presses back THEN the system SHALL handle navigation stack properly within the single activity
4. WHEN deep linking occurs THEN the system SHALL navigate to the correct destination within the single activity
5. WHEN configuration changes happen THEN the system SHALL maintain navigation state properly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want seamless navigation between different sections of the app, so that I can move between library, reader, settings, and other features without delays or jarring transitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between screens THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions without activity recreation overhead
2. WHEN using bottom navigation or drawer navigation THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent UI elements across screens
3. WHEN returning from deep navigation THEN the system SHALL preserve the navigation stack appropriately
4. WHEN using shared elements THEN the system SHALL support smooth transitions between fragments
5. WHEN navigating THEN the system SHALL maintain scroll positions and form states where appropriate

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement clean architecture patterns, so that the codebase is more maintainable, testable, and follows modern Android development best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the architecture THEN the system SHALL separate concerns into presentation, domain, and data layers
2. WHEN handling business logic THEN the system SHALL use use cases/interactors in the domain layer
3. WHEN managing UI state THEN the system SHALL use ViewModels with proper lifecycle awareness
4. WHEN handling data THEN the system SHALL implement repository pattern with proper abstraction
5. WHEN injecting dependencies THEN the system SHALL use dependency injection with proper scoping

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to modernize the UI layer with consistent fragment-based architecture, so that the app benefits from better navigation patterns, improved performance, and maintainable UI components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating UI components THEN the system SHALL use fragments with proper lifecycle management
2. WHEN implementing navigation THEN the system SHALL use Navigation Component with fragment destinations
3. WHEN handling UI state THEN the system SHALL use ViewBinding and proper state management patterns
4. WHEN managing complex UI THEN the system SHALL implement proper fragment communication patterns
5. WHEN theming THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent theming across all fragments

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to maintain all existing functionality during the migration, so that I don't lose any features or experience degraded performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the migrated app THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing features and functionality
2. WHEN reading novels THEN the system SHALL maintain the same reading experience and performance
3. WHEN managing library THEN the system SHALL preserve all library management capabilities
4. WHEN using downloads THEN the system SHALL maintain offline reading functionality
5. WHEN using extensions THEN the system SHALL preserve extension system functionality
6. WHEN using TTS THEN the system SHALL maintain text-to-speech capabilities
7. WHEN using sync features THEN the system SHALL preserve backup and sync functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement proper state management, so that the app handles complex UI states, loading states, and error states consistently across all screens.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading data THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading states
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle and display errors consistently
3. WHEN managing complex UI state THEN the system SHALL use sealed classes or similar patterns for state representation
4. WHEN handling user interactions THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and handle edge cases
5. WHEN managing global state THEN the system SHALL use appropriate state management solutions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement proper testing architecture, so that the migrated code is thoroughly testable with unit tests, integration tests, and UI tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing business logic THEN the system SHALL be testable with unit tests
2. WHEN implementing repositories THEN the system SHALL support mocking for testing
3. WHEN creating ViewModels THEN the system SHALL be testable with proper test doubles
4. WHEN implementing navigation THEN the system SHALL support navigation testing
5. WHEN creating fragment-based UI THEN the system SHALL support fragment testing with proper test utilities

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to have improved performance and memory usage, so that it runs smoothly on various Android devices with better battery life.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the app THEN the system SHALL have reduced memory footprint compared to multi-activity architecture
2. WHEN navigating THEN the system SHALL have faster navigation with reduced overhead
3. WHEN handling large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement proper pagination and lazy loading
4. WHEN managing resources THEN the system SHALL properly clean up resources and prevent memory leaks
5. WHEN running background tasks THEN the system SHALL optimize battery usage and background processing

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain backward compatibility and migration safety, so that existing users can upgrade seamlessly without data loss or functionality issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN upgrading the app THEN the system SHALL preserve all user data and preferences
2. WHEN handling deep links THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing deep link patterns
3. WHEN using intents THEN the system SHALL handle external intents properly in the new architecture
4. WHEN migrating gradually THEN the system SHALL support hybrid architecture during transition period
5. WHEN rolling back THEN the system SHALL support safe rollback mechanisms if needed

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and migration guides, so that the team can understand the new architecture and contribute effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the architecture THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive code documentation
2. WHEN creating new patterns THEN the system SHALL provide examples and usage guidelines
3. WHEN migrating components THEN the system SHALL include migration guides for different component types
4. WHEN onboarding developers THEN the system SHALL provide architecture decision records (ADRs)
5. WHEN maintaining the code THEN the system SHALL include troubleshooting guides and best practices
