# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the Novel Library Android application from Injekt dependency injection to Hilt (Dagger-Hilt). The migration will modernize the dependency injection system to use Google's recommended solution, improve compile-time safety, better integration with Android components, and enhanced testing capabilities.

The current application uses Injekt for dependency injection with manual registration and lazy injection patterns. The goal is to replace this with Hilt's annotation-based system while maintaining all existing functionality and improving code maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from Injekt to Hilt dependency injection, so that the app uses Google's recommended DI solution with better compile-time safety and Android integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the app THEN the system SHALL use Hilt instead of Injekt for all dependency injection
2. WHEN injecting dependencies THEN the system SHALL use @Inject constructor annotation instead of injectLazy()
3. WHEN creating modules THEN the system SHALL use @Module and @InstallIn annotations instead of Injekt.register()
4. WHEN scoping dependencies THEN the system SHALL use Hilt scopes (@Singleton, @ActivityScoped, etc.)
5. WHEN the app runs THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality without regression

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Hilt integration with Android components, so that ViewModels, Fragments, and Services can use dependency injection seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating ViewModels THEN the system SHALL use @HiltViewModel annotation with constructor injection
2. WHEN creating Fragments THEN the system SHALL use @AndroidEntryPoint annotation for injection
3. WHEN creating Activities THEN the system SHALL use @AndroidEntryPoint annotation for injection
4. WHEN creating Services THEN the system SHALL use @AndroidEntryPoint annotation for injection
5. WHEN using Application class THEN the system SHALL use @HiltAndroidApp annotation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to maintain existing dependency relationships and scoping, so that the migration doesn't break existing functionality or introduce memory leaks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN injecting repositories THEN the system SHALL maintain singleton scope for data layer components
2. WHEN injecting network components THEN the system SHALL maintain proper scoping for OkHttp, Retrofit instances
3. WHEN injecting database components THEN the system SHALL maintain singleton scope for Room database and DAOs
4. WHEN injecting UI components THEN the system SHALL use appropriate scoping for ViewModels and UI-related dependencies
5. WHEN managing lifecycle THEN the system SHALL prevent memory leaks through proper scoping

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing support with Hilt, so that unit tests and integration tests can properly mock dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing unit tests THEN the system SHALL support easy mocking of dependencies with @HiltAndroidTest
2. WHEN creating test modules THEN the system SHALL use @TestInstallIn to replace production modules
3. WHEN running instrumentation tests THEN the system SHALL support Hilt test runner for Android tests
4. WHEN testing ViewModels THEN the system SHALL support proper ViewModel testing with Hilt
5. WHEN testing repositories THEN the system SHALL support mocking of data sources and APIs

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want gradual migration capability, so that the migration can be done incrementally without breaking the entire app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating components THEN the system SHALL support hybrid Injekt/Hilt usage during transition
2. WHEN testing migration THEN the system SHALL allow feature flags to enable/disable Hilt for specific components
3. WHEN rolling back THEN the system SHALL support reverting to Injekt if issues are discovered
4. WHEN validating migration THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality during transition
5. WHEN completing migration THEN the system SHALL remove all Injekt dependencies and code

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and debugging support, so that dependency injection issues can be easily identified and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compilation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for missing bindings
2. WHEN runtime errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear stack traces for injection failures
3. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL support Hilt's component tree visualization
4. WHEN validating dependencies THEN the system SHALL detect circular dependencies at compile time
5. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation for common issues

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized build performance, so that the migration to Hilt doesn't significantly impact compilation times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the app THEN the system SHALL maintain reasonable compilation times with Hilt
2. WHEN using incremental builds THEN the system SHALL support efficient incremental compilation
3. WHEN generating code THEN the system SHALL optimize Hilt code generation for build performance
4. WHEN using KSP THEN the system SHALL use Kotlin Symbol Processing instead of KAPT where possible
5. WHEN building variants THEN the system SHALL support efficient multi-variant builds

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and migration guides, so that the team can understand the new DI patterns and contribute effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing Hilt patterns THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive code documentation
2. WHEN creating new components THEN the system SHALL provide examples and usage guidelines
3. WHEN migrating from Injekt THEN the system SHALL include migration guides for different component types
4. WHEN onboarding developers THEN the system SHALL provide Hilt best practices documentation
5. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL include common issues and solutions guide

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper integration with existing architecture patterns, so that Hilt works seamlessly with current MVVM, Repository, and Clean Architecture patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using MVVM pattern THEN the system SHALL properly inject repositories into ViewModels
2. WHEN implementing Repository pattern THEN the system SHALL properly inject data sources into repositories
3. WHEN using Clean Architecture THEN the system SHALL properly separate concerns across layers with DI
4. WHEN managing use cases THEN the system SHALL properly inject dependencies into domain layer components
5. WHEN handling cross-cutting concerns THEN the system SHALL properly inject utilities and managers

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to maintain all existing functionality and performance, so that the Hilt migration is transparent and doesn't impact user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the app THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing features without regression
2. WHEN app starts THEN the system SHALL maintain or improve startup performance
3. WHEN using features THEN the system SHALL maintain existing performance characteristics
4. WHEN handling memory THEN the system SHALL maintain or improve memory usage patterns
5. WHEN running background tasks THEN the system SHALL maintain existing background processing capabilities
