# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the Novel Library Android app from RxJava 1.x to Kotlin Coroutines for better performance, maintainability, and alignment with modern Android development practices. The migration will modernize asynchronous operations while maintaining all existing functionality and improving code readability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the Novel Library app, I want to replace RxJava 1.x with Kotlin Coroutines, so that the codebase uses modern, more maintainable asynchronous programming patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN all RxJava 1.x dependencies SHALL be removed from build.gradle
2. WHEN asynchronous operations are performed THEN they SHALL use Kotlin Coroutines instead of RxJava observables
3. WHEN the app is built THEN it SHALL compile successfully without RxJava 1.x dependencies
4. WHEN existing functionality is tested THEN all features SHALL work identically to the pre-migration state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user of the Novel Library app, I want the app to maintain the same performance and functionality after the migration, so that my reading experience remains uninterrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I perform any app operation THEN the response time SHALL be equal to or better than before migration
2. WHEN I use network-dependent features THEN they SHALL work without any functional regression
3. WHEN I use offline features THEN they SHALL continue to work as expected
4. WHEN background operations run THEN they SHALL complete successfully using coroutines

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working on network operations, I want HTTP requests to use coroutines with Retrofit, so that network calls are more efficient and easier to manage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls THEN Retrofit SHALL use coroutines instead of RxJava adapters
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled properly with coroutine exception handling
3. WHEN multiple concurrent requests are made THEN they SHALL be managed efficiently with coroutines
4. WHEN network operations are cancelled THEN coroutines SHALL handle cancellation gracefully

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working on database operations, I want database queries to use coroutines, so that data access is non-blocking and follows modern patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL run on appropriate coroutine dispatchers
2. WHEN multiple database operations are performed THEN they SHALL be properly sequenced using coroutines
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN exceptions SHALL be handled through coroutine error handling
4. WHEN UI needs to update from database changes THEN it SHALL use Flow instead of RxJava observables

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining UI components, I want UI updates to use coroutines with proper lifecycle management, so that memory leaks are prevented and UI updates are efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI components launch coroutines THEN they SHALL use appropriate lifecycle-aware scopes
2. WHEN activities or fragments are destroyed THEN coroutines SHALL be automatically cancelled
3. WHEN UI updates are needed THEN they SHALL use Flow for reactive data streams
4. WHEN configuration changes occur THEN coroutines SHALL handle state preservation correctly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer working on background tasks, I want long-running operations to use coroutines, so that they are more efficient and easier to test.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN background downloads are performed THEN they SHALL use coroutines instead of RxJava
2. WHEN file operations are executed THEN they SHALL run on IO dispatcher
3. WHEN background sync operations run THEN they SHALL use structured concurrency
4. WHEN background tasks need to be cancelled THEN coroutines SHALL support proper cancellation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer ensuring code quality, I want the migration to include proper testing, so that the reliability of asynchronous operations is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are written THEN they SHALL test coroutines using appropriate testing libraries
2. WHEN testing asynchronous operations THEN tests SHALL use TestCoroutineDispatcher or similar
3. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL verify end-to-end functionality with coroutines
4. WHEN error scenarios are tested THEN coroutine exception handling SHALL be verified

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer reviewing code, I want the migration to follow Kotlin coroutines best practices, so that the code is maintainable and follows industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN coroutines are used THEN they SHALL follow structured concurrency principles
2. WHEN exception handling is implemented THEN it SHALL use proper coroutine exception handling patterns
3. WHEN cancellation is needed THEN it SHALL be implemented using cooperative cancellation
4. WHEN concurrent operations are performed THEN they SHALL use appropriate coroutine builders and scopes
